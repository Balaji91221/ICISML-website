          <h4>Abstract:</h4>
          <p class="abstract">In the last five decades, maturity models have been introduced as reference frameworks for Information System (IS) management in organizations within different industries. In the healthcare domain, maturity models have also been used to address a wide variety of challenges and the high demand for Hospital IS (HIS) implementations. The increasing volume of data exceeds the ability of health organizations to process it for improving clinical and financial efficiencies and quality of care. It is believed that careful and attentive use of Data Analytics in healthcare can transform data into knowledge that can improve patient outcomes and operational efficiency. A maturity model in this conjuncture, is a way of identifying strengths and weaknesses of the HIS maturity and thus, find a way for improvement and evolution. This speech presents a proposal to measure Hospitals Information Systems maturity regarding Data Analytics. The outcome is a maturity model, which includes six stages of HIS growth and maturity progression.</p>

          <h4>Title: Application of Artificial Intelligence-Based Classifiers to Predict the Outcome Measures and Stone-Free Status Following Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy for Staghorn Calculi: Cross-Validation of Data and Estimation of Accuracy</h4>
          <p class="bio">Professor Nithesh Naik's research focuses on developing decision support systems for medical procedures, particularly percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). He employs machine learning techniques to predict postoperative outcomes and stone-free status, providing valuable insights for preoperative counseling.</p>
          <h4>Abstract:</h4>
          <p class="abstract">To develop a decision support system (DSS) for the prediction of the postoperative outcome of a kidney stone treatment procedure, particularly percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) to serve as a promising tool to provide counseling before an operation. The overall procedure includes data collection and prediction model development. Pre-/postoperative variables of 100 patients with staghorn calculus, who underwent PCNL, were collected. For feature vector, variables and categories including patient history variables, kidney stone parameters, and laboratory data were considered. The prediction model was developed using machine learning techniques, which include dimensionality reduction and supervised classification. Multiple classifier scheme was used for prediction. The derived DSS was evaluated by running the leave-one-patient-out cross-validation approach on the data set.</p>

          <h4>Abstract:</h4>
          <p class="abstract">Artificial Intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the field of wearables, empowering these devices to offer personalised and intelligent experiences. AI in wearables enables real-time data analysis and decision-making, enhancing user convenience and functionality. One of the most promising applications of AI in wearables is for activity recognition. AI can be used to identify different types of physical activities as well such as walking, running, swimming, and biking. This information can be used to track fitness goals, provide personalized training recommendations, and detect early signs of health problems. Beyond health and fitness, AI-driven wearables can also augment daily life, such as voice-activated smart glasses that offer contextual information based on what the wearer is looking at. AI-driven wearables are poised to continue transforming the way we interact with technology, making them more responsive, informative, and indispensable in various aspects of our lives. The talk will be focused on the one case study how AI can be used in wearables to differentiate between the normal motion and violent attack for the applications of woman safety.</p>
