          <h4>Abstract:</h4>
          <p class="abstract">In the last five decades, maturity models have been introduced as reference frameworks for Information System (IS) management in organizations within different industries. In the healthcare domain, maturity models have also been used to address a wide variety of challenges and the high demand for Hospital IS (HIS) implementations. The increasing volume of data exceeds the ability of health organizations to process it for improving clinical and financial efficiencies and quality of care. It is believed that careful and attentive use of Data Analytics in healthcare can transform data into knowledge that can improve patient outcomes and operational efficiency. A maturity model in this conjuncture, is a way of identifying strengths and weaknesses of the HIS maturity and thus, find a way for improvement and evolution. This speech presents a proposal to measure Hospitals Information Systems maturity regarding Data Analytics. The outcome is a maturity model, which includes six stages of HIS growth and maturity progression.</p>
